      "message": "I think this is the only place this is still needed for the toolchain respin. Tamas already did this for the CRT objects, and libandroid_support isn\u0027t used on LP64.\n\nWe may need one more sysroot update here (just the S DP2 sysroot merged out) to get the system static libraries as well, but those are an edge case for the NDK anyway.\n\nTamas, we\u0027re going to use a canary built from this to respin the toolchain to cover the sanitizers/builtins/etc, at which point I think this is done. If you know anything still todo lmk 😊",

It\u0027ll only affect sdk variants of things using libc++, which should be minimal, but we should do that just in case.",
